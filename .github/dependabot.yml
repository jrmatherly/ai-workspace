# Dependabot Configuration
# Note: This workspace primarily uses mise.toml for tool version management.
# Dependabot is configured but disabled (open-pull-requests-limit: 0) to maintain
# a valid configuration while avoiding automated PRs.
#
# For child project dependencies, see each project's own dependabot.yml/renovate.json.
